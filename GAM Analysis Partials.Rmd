# Introduction
This notebook reprises selected analyses using GAMs, and then develops nicer
partial effects plots than the `mgcv` defaults.

In particular, I'm interested in generating marginal plots as follows.

1. Zoop density vs. Turbidity
2. Zoop diversity vs. Chl & Zoop diversity vs. Turb (combined 2-part figure)
3. Eurytemora density vs. Turbidity
4. Barnacle vs. Chl & Barnacle vs. Temp (combined 2-part figure)
5. Acartia vs. Temp & Acartia vs. Salinity (combined 2-part figure)

## Building Multi-panel Graphics
In this notebook, I build up the combined plots for our mixed model GAMS
piecewise.  Originally, I was working with marginal graphics produced by the
`ggemmeans()` function.  I was producing separate graphics for each marginal
mean (see below), and had to combine them. Since I was working with completed
graphics (not data frames) I could not rely on `ggplot2`'s faceting
capabilities.

The approach I use here is to pull marginal means for each marginal predictor,
graph them in `ggplot`, then assemble multi-panel graphic using `grid.arrange()`
(which generates a display) or `arrangeGrob()` (which does not).

Since the `ggemmeans()` function no longer works the same way (see below), this
is no longer strictly necessary, but I retain this approach as a minimal
rearrangement of existing code. A companion notebook will look at generating
graphics using faceting, by building up suitably arranged data frames. That
has the advantage of **not** adding extra axis titles and labels between the
two plots.

## General Instructions to Authors About Graphics
The instructions to authors suggests figure widths should line up with columns,
and proposes figure widths should be: 

39 mm   ~  1.54 inches
84 mm   ~ 3.30 inches
129 mm  ~ 5.04 inches
174 mm  ~ 6.85 inches

With height  not to exceed 235 mm (9.25 inches). 

RMarkdown / `knitr` likes figure dimensions in inches. 174 mm is 
about 6.85 inches

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Data
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric", 
                                              "text", "skip", "skip", 
                                              "skip", 
                                              rep("numeric", 10),
                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",
                                              rep("numeric", 12))) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))
```

```{r}
names(station_data)[10:12]
names(station_data)[10:12] <- c('disch_wk', 'disch_day', 'disch_max')
```

Station names are arbitrary, and Erin previously expressed interest in renaming 
them from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
head(station_data)
```

### Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used in the manuscript.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         is_sp_up = season == 'Spring' & Station == 1,
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Density = combined_density,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         Fish = `___61`,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, is_sp_up, DOY, riv_km, 
         disch_wk, disch_day, disch_max,
         Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, DOsat, Chl, 
         Fish, RH, 
         Density, H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## Complete Cases
This drops only two samples, one for missing Zooplankton data, one for missing
fish data.  We needed this  data set to run The `step()` function in other 
notebooks, but here it is just a step towards the next version, which is what we 
will actually use.

```{r}
complete_data <- base_data %>%
  select(Season, Station, Yearf,
         is_sp_up, Temp, Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, RH,
         Density, H, 
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## Reduced Data
The low salinity spring samples are doing something rather different, and they
complicate model fitting. Models are far better behaved if we exclude a few
extreme samples.  These are low salinity, low zooplankton samples.  We have two 
complementary ways to specify which samples to omit, without just omitting
"outliers". The first is to restrict modeling to "marine" samples over a certain
salinity range, and the other is to omit spring upstream samples, which include 
most of the problematic samples.  We eventually decided to go with the first
approach.

```{r}
drop_low <- complete_data %>%
  filter(Sal > 10)    # Pulls three samples, including one fall upstream sample
                      # a fourth low salinity sample lacks zooplankton data
#drop_sp_up <- complete_data %>%
#  filter(! is_sp_up)  # drops four samples
```

```{r}
rm(complete_data)
```

# Total Zooplankton Density
I fit a simplified model without `Station`.  The full model has the same
concurvity problems as before, leading the full model to fails to converge.
While I could alter the convergence criteria to search for a solution, we know
the model that includes Station will have concurvity problems, so there is
little point.

## Reduced Complexity Model
```{r}
density_gam<- gam(log(Density) ~ 
                          #s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          #s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
                          #s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
                          s(Yearf, bs = 're'), 
                        data = drop_low, family = 'gaussian')
summary(density_gam)

```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

# Changes in `ggemmeans()` Function Require a New Approach
## Graphics from `ggemmeans()` now Fail
```{r  error = TRUE}
ggp1 <- ggemmeans(density_gam, terms = 'Turb')
ggp2 <- ggemmeans(density_gam, terms = 'Chl')
```

I'm not sure why that error is popping up. That used to work, as documented in
the version of this notebook saved in November of 2022.  Chances are, there has
been a change in how either `ggemmeans()` or `emmeans()` itself handles names.
The change does not affect simple testing code, so the effect probably relates
to transformed predictor variables, possibly only in the context of GAMs.

## `ggpredict()` does not do what we want
We'll first take the advice in the warning messagess and try using
`ggpredict()`, but it does not work well. `ggpredict()` produces conditional
means, not marginal means. The result is that regardless of the year chosen, the
data do not line up all that well with the (multi-year) raw data. Perhaps the
best apparent fit is for 2016.

```{r}
ggp1 <- ggpredict(density_gam, terms = 'Turb', 
                  condition = c(Yearf = 2016))
```

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
plot(ggp1, add.data  = TRUE, 
     dot.alpha = 0.5, dot.size = 1) +
  geom_rug(aes(y = NULL)) +
  ggtitle('') +
  xlab(expression("Turbidity" ~ "(NTU)"))# +
 # scale_y_continuous( limits = c(0,9000), breaks = c(0, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000))
```

At first blush that looks like it worked, but the data do not line up well with
the (conditional) predictions and the error bars are too narrow. The arbitrary
selection of 2016 as the reference year is *ad hoc*.  It would be far better to
use `emmeans` or `effects` to produce marginal means.  Unfortunately, `effects'
does no know how to handle GAM models, so we need to use `emmeans`.

## Generating a similar graphic "by hand"
I can "roll my own" by calling `emmeans` directly and building up graphics step
by step. The following works if I am explicit about the `log()` term in the
call.  I believe that is a new wrinkle, and probably explains why the call to
`ggemmeans()` no longer works. I used to be able to call emmeans only referring
to "Turb", not "log(Turb)".

First, we calculate 25 points for predictions.
```{r}
r <- range(drop_low$Turb)
stops = seq(r[1], r[2], length.out = 25)
```

Then we calculate the marginal means.
```{r}
test_emms <- emmeans(density_gam, 'log(Turb)', 
                        at = list(`log(Turb)` = log(stops), 'Yearf' = 2015, Chl = 3.86),
                        type = 'response')
test_emms <- as_tibble(test_emms) %>%
  mutate(Turb = exp(`log(Turb)`)) %>%
  relocate(Turb)
test_emms
```

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(test_emms, aes(Turb, response)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL), alpha = 0.20) +
  geom_line() +
  #geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = drop_low, mapping = aes(x = Turb, y = Density), 
             size = 1, color = "gray40") +
  geom_rug(data = drop_low, mapping = aes(x = Turb, y = NULL)) +
  xlab(expression("Turbidity" ~ "(NTU)")) +
  ylab(expression("Zooplankton Density (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" ))
```

Note that this graphic is simpler than the one produced by `ggpredict()`
(and `ggeffects()` or `ggemmeans()`). In particular, it does not have the grid
in back of the figure.

## Functions to capture that logic
I create some helper functions to manage much of the repetitive coding.

### Find Evenly Spaced Points
```{r}
find_stops <- function(.dat, .predictor, .nstops = 25) {
  .predictor <- ensym(.predictor)
  r <- range(.dat[[.predictor]])
  stops = seq(r[1], r[2], length.out = .nstops)
  
  return(stops)
}
```

### Conduct The Analysis
```{r}
marginal_analysis <- function(.dat, .predictor, .model, 
                              .nstops = 25, .logx = TRUE, .transy = TRUE) {
  .predictor <- ensym(.predictor)
  
  the_name <- as.character(.predictor)
  the_log_name <- paste0("log(", the_name, ")")
  
  # The following finds stops linear in the original predictor scale.
  # That is appropriate for the planned graphics, where both axes are 
  # untransformed.
  stops <- find_stops(.dat, !!.predictor, .nstops)
  # browser()
  if (.logx) {
    stopslist <- list(log(stops))
    names(stopslist) <- the_log_name
    
    emms <- emmeans(.model, the_log_name, 
                    at = stopslist,
                    type = 'response')
    emms <- as_tibble(emms) 
    #browser()
    emms <- emms %>%
      mutate( !!the_name := exp(emms[[the_log_name]]))
  }
  else {
    #browser()
    stopslist <- list(stops)
    names(stopslist) <- the_name
    
    emms <- emmeans(.model, the_name, 
                    at = stopslist,
                    type = 'response')
    emms <- as_tibble(emms)
    
  }
  #The default name of the output of emmeans() differs if the response
  #variable is transformed or untransformed. This makes it consistent.
  if (! .transy) {
    emms <-  emms %>%
      rename(response = emmean)
  }
  return(emms)
}
```

```{r}
a <- marginal_analysis(drop_low, Turb,  
                           .model = density_gam)
```

### Construct a Plot
This function does not handle axis labels (to simplify the code). You still
have to change them manually.
```{r}
marginal_plot <- function(.emms, .data, .predictor, .response) {
  #browser()
  .predictor   <- ensym(.predictor)
  .response    <- ensym(.response)
  the_name     <- as.character(.predictor)
  the_log_name <- paste0("log(", the_name, ")")
  
  xlocs <- .emms[[the_name]]
  
  #"response" is the default name of the output column in `emmeans()`
  # lower.CL and # upper.CL are also default column names.
  
  ggplot(.emms, aes(xlocs, response)) +   
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL), fill = "grey80") +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(data = .data, mapping = aes(x = !!.predictor, y = !!.response),
             size = 1, color = "gray40") +
    geom_rug(data = .data, mapping = aes(x = !!.predictor, y = NULL)) +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 9),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 8))
}
```

```{r}
marginal_plot(a, drop_low, Turb, Density)
```
 
# Total Zooplankton Density, Revisited
## Generate Data
```{r}
p1.data <- marginal_analysis(drop_low, Turb, density_gam, 
                                  .nstops = 25, .logx = TRUE)
p2.data <- marginal_analysis(drop_low, Chl, density_gam, 
                                  .nstops = 25, .logx = TRUE)
```

## Generate Graphics
```{r}
plt1 <- marginal_plot(p1.data, drop_low, Turb, Density) +
  xlab(expression("Turbidity" ~ "(NTU)")) +
  ylab(expression("Zooplankton Density (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" ))
```

```{r}
plt2 <- marginal_plot(p2.data, drop_low, Chl, Density) +
  xlab(expression("Chlorophyll (" * mu * g * L ^-1 ~")")) +
  ylab(expression("Zooplankton Density (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" ))
```

## Assemble the Multi-panel Plot
`grid.arrange()` automatically generates output, so is useful in interactive
data analysis.  (In this context, `arrangeGrob()' would be similar, but not
produce immediate graphic output.)  If you save output to a variable, the result
is a `gtable`, not a simple plot. Some functions know what to do with that,
others don't.
```{r fig.width = 5.04, fig.height = 2.2}
grphc <- grid.arrange(plt1, plt2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

## Save the Plot
```{r}
ggsave(file='figures/density.png', grphc,
width = 5.04, height = 2.2)
ggsave('figures/density.pdf', grphc, device = cairo_pdf,
width = 5.04, height = 2.2)
```

## Supplementary Graphic
Here I save only `plt1` as a separate figure.  This graphic is the same height
as the others, but slightly wider than a half plot, to correspond to widths
recommended in the instructions to authors.
```{r}
ggsave('figures/density by turbidity.png', plt1,
         width = 3.30, height = 2.2)
ggsave('figures/density by turbidity.pdf', plt1, device = cairo_pdf, 
       width = 3.30, height = 2.2)
```

# Single Species Models
## Model Choice
Our model alternatives are similar to the choices we had for the Total Density 
model. The problem is, we can't use any of the continuous data distributions in 
GAMS with zero values (at least relying on the canonical link functions) because
(log(0) = -Inf; 1/0 = Inf, 1 / 0*0 = Inf). The easiest solution is to add some 
finite small quantity to the density data, and predict that. Here we predict
log(Density + 1) using Gaussian models.

## Automating Analysis of Separate Species
I automate analysis of all species by using a "nested" Tibble.  This is a
convenient alternative to writing a "for" loop to run multiple identical
analyses.

I create a "long" data source, based on our reduced data set (which omits low
salinity samples).

```{r}
spp_data <- drop_low %>%
  select(Yearf, Season, Station, Temp,
          Sal, Turb, Chl, Fish, 
          Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Yearf:Fish), names_to = 'Species', values_to = 'Density')
```

Next, I create a function to run the analysis.  This function takes a data frame
or tibble as an argument.  The tibble must have data columns with the correct 
names.

The initial GAM fits for some species had a lot of wiggles in them, to an 
extent that I thought did not make much scientific sense, so I decided to reduce
the dimensionality of the GAM smoothers, by adding the parameter `k= 4`. Lower
numbers constrain the GAM to fit smoother lines, which I think improve
interpretability with noisy environmental data.

```{r}
my_gam <- function(.dat) {
  
  gam(log1p(Density) ~ 
        s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 5) +
        s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 5) + 
        s(log1p(Fish),bs="ts", k = 5) +
        s(Yearf, bs = 're'),
      data = .dat, family = "gaussian")
}
```

Next, I create the nested tibble, and conduct the analysis on each species....

```{r}
spp_analysis <- spp_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(gam_mods = map(data, my_gam))
```

We are now ready to look at the model results. While we could do that
programmatically using a "for" loop, it's awkward to look through a long list of
output, so I step through each species of interest manually.  This also gives me
a bit more control over what graphics to produce for each species, since the
best models differ.

## Acartia
```{r}
spp = 'Acartia'
mod <- spp_analysis$gam_mods[spp_analysis$Species == spp][[1]]
dat <- spp_analysis$data[spp_analysis$Species == spp][[1]]
summary(mod)
```

### Plot GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(mod)
par(oldpar)
```

### Combined Graphic
#### GenerateFData
```{r}
p1.data <- marginal_analysis(dat, Temp, mod, 
                                  .nstops = 25, .logx = FALSE)

p2.data <- marginal_analysis(dat, Sal, mod, 
                                  .nstops = 25, .logx = FALSE)
```

####Generate Graphics
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
plt1 <- marginal_plot(p1.data, dat, Temp, Density) +
  xlab(expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)")) +
  ylab(expression("Acartia Density (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" ))
plt1
```

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
plt2 <- marginal_plot(p2.data, dat, Sal, Density) +
  xlab(expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)")) +
  ylab(expression("Acartia Density (" * m ^-3 ~ ")" ))
plt2
```

#### Assemble The Multi-panel Plot
##### Adjust Vertical Axes so They Match
Since we are generating separate graphics, `ggplot2` makes different choices 
about the axis breaks and limits. In particular, `ggplot2` makes decisions based
on the extremes of the error bands, which we actually don't need to show.  As a
result, we need to be explicit about axis properties.  A subtlety here:  setting
axis limits with `coord_cartesian()` does not remove data, thus "clipping"
the error band to the visible range vertically.  If we used `ylim()` instead, 
the error band gets truncated (horizontally) once either extreme extends 
outside of the visual plot area.

```{r fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5}
plt1 <- plt1 +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:5*2500)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12500))
  
plt2 <- plt2 +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:5*2500)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12500))
```

#### Save Multi-Panel Graphic
