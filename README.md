Code to generate "pretty" partial effects plots from GAM models of plankton on 
the Penobscot River

Erin Ambrose recently prepared a manuscript based on her graduate work looking 
at species composition of plankton in Penobscot Bay, Maine, working with Rachel
Lasley Rasher, at the University of Southern Maine. Lasley Rasher is on the 
faculty  at the University of Southern Maine, which also hosts the Casco Bay 
Estuary Partnership.  

At Lasley Rasher's request, I helped Ambrose early on in her graduate work with
some R coding issues, and later assisted with preparing graphics for the 
manuscript. I later assisted with preparation of final data reanalysis, in 
response to some thorough suggestions from reviewers of the manuscript as 
originally submitted.

As we completed final data analyses on the paper, we realized plots of the 
predicted partial effects of environmental variables helped clarify ecological 
and biophysical relationships.  Unfortunately, the default partial plots 
generated by `mgcv` are not, we felt, suitable for publication or even for use 
in online supplementary information.

This repository includes code for generating prettier partial effects plots.
